Lets you pick a SOURCE JSON (the binds you want) and a TARGET JSON (the config to update).

It removes all "key" fields from the target, then copies the "key" fields from the source for modules that exist in both files.

Saves the result next to the target as TARGETNAME_bind.json (the original files are left untouched).

File dialogs open in %APPDATA%\.minecraft\config\Myau by default.

The UI language auto-detects (French or English)
